# Independent Study

## Synopsis

Project to build an end to end question answering system in multiple languages with industry precision of 95% and a 90% recall. 

## Design Goal

Overall this repository is built on top of PyTorch; therefore, it will follow PyTorch's design footsteps. As O’Reilly Data Show Podcast explained, this means, "PyTorch is designed to be intuitive, linear in thought and easy to use. When you execute a line of code, it gets executed. There isn’t an asynchronous view of the world". PyTorch is has an imperative approach. Wikipedia defines imperative as, "imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state". 

Here is a good article discussing imperative: https://tylermcginnis.com/imperative-vs-declarative-programming/ 

In imperative programming languages, it's important to conform to the operations model of the machine. Similarly the article above states, "Declarative programming is “the act of programming in languages that conform to the mental model of the developer rather than the operational model of the machine”".

It's important the source code in this library defines utility methods that are named after the operational model.
