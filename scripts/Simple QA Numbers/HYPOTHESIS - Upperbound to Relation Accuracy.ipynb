    "\n",
    "- The numbers concerning `Given Relation Subject Accuracy Approximate Upperbound` match between this notebook [9496 of 10845] and `HYPOTHESIS - Question Refers to Multiple Subjects` [9495 of 10640].\n",
    "- Subject and relation accuracy drops more than object accuracy depending on being conditioned with the true relation or not; therefore, I believe a better metric is object accuracy due to invariance to relation ambiguity.\n",
    "- With a 84.05% upperbound then the SOTA 78.7% is within 93.6% of the upperbound. We've reduced the room of improvement from 21.3% to 6.4% by determining the upperbound.\n",
    "- With our upperbound measurement, we do not use any text normalization strategies; therefore, it could be higher if synonyms are factored in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Empirical Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "We check every example to ensure that a human evaluator such as myself is unable to differentiate between the multiple relations. In `HYPOTHESIS - Question Refers to Multiple Subjects.ipynb` we check to ensure that a human evaluator cannot differentiate between the multiple subject mids. \n",
