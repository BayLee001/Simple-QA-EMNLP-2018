    "\n",
    "### Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "`Simple QA` dataset downloaded from: https://www.dropbox.com/s/tohrsllcfy7rch4/SimpleQuestions_v2.tgz\n",
    "\n",
    "`Freebase Triples` downloaded from: https://developers.google.com/freebase/\n",

    "In `Freebase to PostgreSQL` notebook, code is provided for building up a PostgreSQL with Freebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background On Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge Bases contain facts expressed as triples (subject, relationship, object), where subject and object are entities and relationship describes the type of (directed) link between these entities. The simple QA problem we address here consist in finding the answer to questions that can be rephrased as queries of the form (subject, relationship, ?), asking for all objects linked to subject by relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question What do Jamaican people speak ?, for instance, could be rephrased as the Freebase query (jamaica, language spoken, ?). In other words, fetching a single fact from a KB is sufficient to answer correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question Consistency:\n",
    "    - [ ] Hypothesis some questions do not fit the distribution. Look at the bottom 1% of questions that have unique tokens. We known double spaces or question marks are not consistent.\n",
    "- Entity Detection\n",
    "    - [x] Hypothesis is that the object to be detected is not found in the question. Figure out how many objects are not in the question.\n",
    "    - [ ] Experiment with CRF and copy model for entity detection.\n",
    "- Entity Linking\n",
    "    - [x] Santity check that the true object is in FB5M.\n",
    "    - [x] Santity check all MIDs have an associated english name.\n",
    "    - [x] Hypothesis that objects have duplicates. Given the true object, measure how many duplicates need to be parsed through on the validation set. \n",
    "        - [ ] Hypothesis there are external features that help linking. Experiment with which features best predict the object.\n",
    "            - [ ] Hypothesis is that type of the entity could help disambiguate duplicates.\n",
    "- Relation Detection\n",
    "    - [x] Hypothesis that some of the relations occur in dev and do not occur in train. Measure this affect.\n",
    "        - [ ] Hypothesis that the unknown relations can be extrapolated from words. Check if some of the relation words are unknown.\n",
    "        - [ ] Hypothesis that the unknown relations can be extrapolated from words. Check which levels 1, 2 or 3 are unknown in the relation.\n",
    "        - [ ] Experiment with beam search for relations and word tokenization. Beam search will help us get the top 2 - 3 beams.\n",
    "    - [ ] Hypothesis that questions without entities map to the same relations; it's impossible to tell between some relations; therefore, it's not possible to predict the relation.\n",
    "- Relation and Entity to Fact\n",
    "    - [x] Santity check that FB5M has the facts corresponding to the answer given the true relation and the true entity.\n",
