    "\n",
    "- Question Consistency:\n",
    "    - [ ] Hypothesis some questions do not fit the distribution. Look at the bottom 1% of questions that have unique tokens. We known double spaces or question marks are not consistent.\n",
    "- Entity Detection\n",
    "    - [x] Hypothesis is that the object to be detected is not found in the question. Figure out how many objects are not in the question.\n",
    "    - [ ] Experiment with CRF and copy model for entity detection.\n",
    "- Entity Linking\n",
    "    - [x] Santity check that the true object is in FB5M.\n",
    "    - [x] Santity check all MIDs have an associated english name.\n",
    "    - [x] Hypothesis that objects have duplicates. Given the true object, measure how many duplicates need to be parsed through on the validation set. \n",
    "        - [ ] Hypothesis there are external features that help linking. Experiment with which features best predict the object.\n",
    "            - [ ] Hypothesis is that type of the entity could help disambiguate duplicates.\n",
    "- Relation Detection\n",
    "    - [x] Hypothesis that some of the relations occur in dev and do not occur in train. Measure this affect.\n",
    "        - [ ] Hypothesis that the unknown relations can be extrapolated from words. Check if some of the relation words are unknown.\n",
    "        - [ ] Hypothesis that the unknown relations can be extrapolated from words. Check which levels 1, 2 or 3 are unknown in the relation.\n",
    "        - [ ] Experiment with beam search for relations and word tokenization. Beam search will help us get the top 2 - 3 beams.\n",
    "- Relation and Entity to Fact\n",
    "    - [x] Santity check that FB5M has the facts corresponding to the answer given the true relation and the true entity."
